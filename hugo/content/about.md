I'm a backend developer currently working at [Utility Warehouse](https://www.utilitywarehouse.co.uk). 
There spent I most of my time building micro-services in [go](https://golang.org) using [gRPC](https://grpc.io)
and deploying them on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). Lots of our services are event driven, so we have build
some nice tools to interact with various event streams like [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) and [NATS streaming](https://nats.io). 
Go check them out on our [GitHub](https://github.com/uw-labs).

Every now and then I write a blog post on [Medium](https://medium.com/@michal.bock) about the stuff I'm currently working on,
though I might start adding posts here instead.

I've got a masters degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Oxford, where I also did a bit of rowing and kickboxing,
though not really doing any of those anymore.
