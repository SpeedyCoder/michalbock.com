I'm a software engineer currently working at [Deliveroo](https://deliveroo.co.uk). 

I've previously worked at [Utility Warehouse](https://uw.co.uk), where I spent most of my time building micro-services in [go](https://golang.org) 
using [gRPC](https://grpc.io) and [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) and deploying them on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). 
During my time there I've also worked on tools like [Substrate](https://github.com/uw-labs/substrate) and [Proximo](https://github.com/uw-labs/proximo) 
that provide a simple abstraction for interacting with message streaming systems like [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) and [NATS streaming](https://nats.io). 

Every now and then I write a blog post on [Medium](https://medium.com/@michal.bock) about the stuff I'm currently working on,
though I might start adding posts here instead.

I've got a masters degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from Oxford, where I also did a bit of rowing and kickboxing,
though not really doing any of those anymore.
